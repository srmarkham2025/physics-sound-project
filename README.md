# Comparing Overtones of Instruments using Spectrograms and Fourier Series 🌊

## Description
This project dynamically analyzes recordings of various musical instruments using spectrograms and Fourier Series.

## Features
- Recreates the waveform of three instruments
- Detects the fundamental frequency and overtones of audio
- Calculates overtone deviation from a typical standing wave.
